Hey, I’m Karina. I’m a Petroleum Engineer.

Not too long ago, I was searching for a learning path to follow, to overcome my impressions about the **moral case** of fossil fuels. Found a couple of online courses and sign up. Actually, I am motivated **to do** many cool things related to data science and machine learning.

Expecting to share my experience through it with you folks!
