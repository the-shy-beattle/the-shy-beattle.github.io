# Residential Outdoor and Landscaping Water Use

In this water footprint challenge we focus on residential outdoor water use. Between 50-75% of residential water consumption in the U.S. is outdoor water use ([Milesi et al., 2005](http://secure.ntsg.umt.edu/publications/2005/MREDTN05/MappingCristinaMIlesi.pdf)). Outdoor water use for lawn irrigation peaks in the summer months, the same time when water delivery systems operate at peak system capacity, and is therefore an important target for water conservation programs. Some cities in the western U.S. target water conservation for outdoor use through rewards systems that encourage the transformation of lawns into xeriscaping. “[Brown is the new green](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/garden/brown-is-the-new-green.html)” is the motto of these campaigns.

In this challenge you will explore residential outdoor water use in the western U.S.
