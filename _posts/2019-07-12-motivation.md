For a time, like many, I thought we had to focus ourselves on the outcome. It is easy to get caught in the joy of daydreaming, that sense of breathtaking possibility about what it might happen if we succeed. However, visualizing ourselves achieving our goals will not make the path in between less blurry.

Certain things you own to yourself to grasp the most of it. As long as you don’t get distracted envisioning yourself into the sweetness and treats, you could spend more time thinking, asking incisive questions about the path to follow, adjusting your belief, to keep you motivated. A good part of being able to identify and divide our goals into smaller ones is to visualize ourselves in the core process. That is, in fact, the real job we need to do.

Of course, this skill doesn’t come easy for most of the people. As we shall see, breaking down our objectives will help us understand these affairs.

We might be more likely commit to a midterm goal that can be the jack-of-all-trades we needed to pursue our path towards higher peaks. As we become aware of midpoints in our route towards climbing higher mountains, we will value the most the perks and small rewards through it..

## **The shy beetle writes**

It seems even warily the way we refer to our needs and inner desires. As much as I wanted to believe that we are fearless towards our goals, soon I came to notice that we are more like a shy beetle when we have to acknowledge or even speak of them out loud.

Beetles tend to protect themselves each time their senses flash; they swing their wings to escape in a rapid flight, like them, we will hinge on our ability to enclose ourselves, to avoid detractors. — is built into their nature and also in ours.

Be the shy beetle that writes.

Manage yourself to write a draft, start with a few sentences to describe key-points that are easy to spot as you advance. Needless to say, the main purpose of these exercises rather than evaluate us — is to build a solid ground to get started.

## **Unfold the magic**

Some emotions will arise as we start to take a step further to carry out our goals. The same range of emotions is conveyed as we approached our deadline. We might feel somewhat overwhelmed or inadequate a feeling that surely you have been related to — as I have been.

Partly due that we often rush into things to get them done, without thinking through. To achieve our goals is not a static two-fold process as we have been told. Instead, it is a dynamic process.in which we are embedded in from the very moment we decide to articulate them.

We might assume that getting the big picture about our goals is going to bring us into sharp focus. However, it will prevent us from zoom-in, to pay attention to the details, as we submerge into unfolding our path. Whether and how to parse our path going to depend on the natural capacity of breaking down into pieces our main target.  
If reaching a goal requires steps A, B, and C, to define the tasks for each step is fundamental, so we won't go and start blending all at the cost of spending vast amounts of energy and obtain poor results.  
Framing our perspective to simplify the number of tasks we must perform per  
step and executing in a period is undoubtedly a better way to attain our goals. In other words: Avoid multi-tasking.
