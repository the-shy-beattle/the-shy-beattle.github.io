Hey, I’m Karina. I’m a petroleum engineering.

Not too long ago, I was searching for a learning path to follow, to overcome my impressions about the moral case of fossil fuels. Found a couple of courses online and sign up. Actually, I am motivated to do many cool things related to data science and machine learning.

Expecting to share my experience trough it with you folks!
